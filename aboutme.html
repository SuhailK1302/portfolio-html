    <p>I am Suhail, a passionate individual who embarked on an incredible journey through the corridors of education, shaping myself into the person I am today. <br>My schooling commenced at Dheeniya Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Kilakarai, where I embarked on my early academic endeavors until the 2nd standard. Thereafter, I continued my educational voyage at Muhyidheeniya Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Kilakarai, where I thrived in the 3rd standard. The pursuit of knowledge led me to St. Francis International School, Vellalanvilai, Suranugdi, Kanyakumari District, where I further honed my skills during my 4th and 5th standards from 2012 to 2014. <br>Continuing my academic journey, I returned to Muhyidheeniya Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Kilakarai, from 6th to 12th standard, from 2015 to 2020. It was during this time that I achieved remarkable milestones, securing the prestigious 3rd rank in school during my 10th standard and a commendable 91% in my 12th standard examinations.In the pursuit of higher education, I joined Aalim Muhammed Salgh College of Engineering, Avadi, Chennai, in 2021, pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology. The thirst for knowledge drove me to explore beyond the conventional curriculum, and I successfully completed an NPTEL course in programming with Java in 2022, and a comprehensive Full Stack Web Development course on Udemy in 2023. My passion for learning extended to attending workshops on IoT at SA Engineering College, as well as delving into the intricacies of front-end and back-end development at Devtown.
<br>Academically, I have maintained an impressive CGPA of 8.6 during my two years at Aalim Muhammed Salgh College of Engineering, availing myself of opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. My dedication to my studies is matched only by my enthusiasm for life. I find solace in my faith, which guides my actions and instills values of compassion and empathy.
My proficiency in Tamil and English, along with my burgeoning skills in Hindi and Malayalam, opens doors to connect with people from diverse backgrounds. When it comes to handling pressure, I thrive in challenging situations, confidently delivering exceptional results. Diligence and precision are my hallmarks, ensuring that every task is completed impeccably.
With unwavering determination and a heart full of dreams, <br>I look forward to continuing my journey, embracing new experiences, and contributing positively to the world around me. As I venture forth, I remain true to my roots, cherishing the lessons and memories that have shaped me into the person I am today.</p>
