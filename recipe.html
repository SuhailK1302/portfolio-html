                <li>Soy sauce (optional, for umami flavor)</li>
                <li>Sesame oil (optional, for richness)</li>
                <li>Ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Cooking oil (for saut√©ing the filling)</li>
                <li>Cilantro (coriander leaves, chopped - for freshness)</li>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Process:</h2>
            <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour (Maida) and a pinch of salt.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add water while kneading the mixture into a smooth, pliable dough.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes to an hour. This allows the gluten to relax and makes rolling easier.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>For the Fillings:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>For Non-Vegetarian Momos: In a separate bowl, mix minced meat of your choice with finely chopped garlic, grated ginger, chopped spring onions, chopped green chilies, soy sauce (if using), sesame oil (if using), ground black pepper, and salt. Combine the ingredients thoroughly to ensure even seasoning.</li>
                    <li>For Vegetarian Momos: In a separate bowl, mix finely chopped vegetables (cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, etc.) with garlic, ginger, spring onions, green chilies, soy sauce (if using), sesame oil (if using), ground black pepper, and salt. Make sure the vegetables are finely chopped for a consistent filling.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Assembling the Momos:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a small portion of the rested dough and roll it into a thin circle on a floured surface. The edges should be slightly thinner than the center.</li>
                    <li>Place a spoonful of the filling (meat or vegetable) in the center of the rolled dough.</li>
                    <li>Begin folding the edges of the dough in a pleated manner, pinching and twisting them together at the top to seal the filling. Create a circular shape with the pleats, ensuring the filling is completely enclosed.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Steaming the Momos:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grease the steamer trays or line them with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Arrange the prepared Momos on the steamer trays, leaving some space between each to avoid sticking during steaming.</li>
                    <li>Steam the Momos for about 8-10 minutes on medium heat or until the dough becomes translucent and cooked.</li>
                    <li>Once steamed, carefully remove the Momos from the steamer and place them on a serving plate.</li>
                </ol>
            <h2>Serving Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Momos are typically served hot and can be accompanied by a variety of dipping sauces such as spicy red chili sauce or savory soy-based sauce.</li>
                    <li>Garnish the Momos with chopped cilantro (coriander leaves) for an extra touch of freshness and presentation.</li>
                </ol>
